# Analytical Insights

## 1. Which users are the most active reviewers over time?
From this query, we can identify the most valuable users who are active reviewers.  A tiny fraction of users produce most content. Typical users likely write 0–2 reviews (not shown here). 
That implies that review distribution is highly unequal, dominated by super contributors.

## 2. Identifying the most helpful Review per Game
This dataset identifies the most helpful review for each game. It shows that a small number of reviews can disproportionately shape how a game is perceived. 
Such data can support ranking systems or recommendation models that prioritize informative reviews over sheer volume.
